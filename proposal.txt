**Project Proposal**

*Description*

Stack Focus	:	The capstone project is more back-end focused, since the majority of the project will 
			focus on retreiving and sending information to a database or externally.  The project
			will be using React for the front-end interface and Node.js for the back-end applications.  
			The database portion of the project will be using PostgreSQL to help store information
			on the various air-conditioning systems and users to recieve their recommendations.

Type		:	The project will be a website that the user would use to receive recommendations for 
			an air-conditioning system.

Goal		:	The goal of the project is to have the user receive a recommended air-conditioning
			system that they would be able to send for more information and pricing.

Users		:	The demographic for this project would be potential customers who are in the market for
			air-conditioning systems.

Data		:	I will be using data from an XML file that I have access to from my current position.
